PseudoCode

Main Class:

initialize text1 to "gears of war"
initialize text2 to "History of warriors"
Display "Longest Common Substring" plus CommonSubString(text1, text2)

String CommonSubString (String text1, String text2) Class:

initialize integer a to text1.length
initialize integer b to text2.length
initialize integer first to 0
initialize integer last to a
initialize 2D integer array named target to new integer a+1 b+1

Nested Loops:
FOR initialize integer i to 1
    i is less then or equal to a
    increment i
    FOR initialize integer j to 1
        j is less then or equal to b
        increment j
        IF character at position(i-1) in text1 is equal to character at j-1 in text2
        THEN set target to value of target[i-1][j-1] plus 1
            IF target is greater then first
                THEN set first to target
                     set last to i

             END IF
         END IF
      END FOR
    END FOR

   IF first is equal to 0
    THEN return " "
 END IF

 return substring method on text1 starting from last to first, up to last
